With this method it is possible to install the new version or to update from version 0.1.9 and onwards to 
the latest version installed using these steps.
 
(1) Increment version number for each bundle changed since previous version
(2) Perform a Clean Build
(3) Increment version number in feature file(s)
(4) Delete the following files in the site project before building a new version

	- All jar files in the features folder
	- Delete artifacts.jar and content.jar in the root folder 
(5) Select add feature from the Site Map tab in site.xml and add the feature file(s) from (1)
	- Remember to add the feature file(s) as a subordinate to the no.javatime.interface.category category
	- Remember to NOT remove earlier features in the category in Site Map tab 
	  (necessary for to be able to update from an earlier version) 
(6) Select Build all to generate the site
(7) On the InPlace web site move the current version from the updates folder to the test folder
(8) Upload the generated site to the updates folder
(9) Increment the version number on javatime.no site and the Eclipse Marketplace 
(10) Test install and update (from the previous to the new version)
(11) Commit all files to git and tag the new version  

Remove last new created version (assuming that the last version has not been published to the market place):
(1) After changing source code - Perform a Clean Build
(2) Delete the following files in the site project before building a new version 
	- All jar files in the plugins folder 
	- All jar files in the features folder
	- Delete artifacts.jar and content.jar in the root folder 
(3) Remove the last generated version from in the version list on the Site Map tab

Misc:
 To show more than the last version on the update site the plugins and feature jar from earlier versions must be uploaded to the update site.
